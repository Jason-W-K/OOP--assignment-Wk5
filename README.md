# 🧠 Heroic Polymorph Showcase

## 📚 Overview

This project is a two-part demonstration of object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python. It blends expressive class design with dynamic polymorphism, showcasing how code can be both technically sound and narratively engaging.

## 🏗️ Part 1: Design Your Own Class — *Superhero System*

In this section, I created a custom class hierarchy centered around superheroes. The goal was to use constructors, attributes, methods, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism to bring each character to life.

### 🔍 Key Features:
- **Base Class**: `Superhero` with attributes like `name`, `power`, and `origin`
- **Subclasses**:
  - `TechHero` with a private gadget (`__gadget`) demonstrating encapsulation
  - `NatureHero` with an elemental affinity
- **Polymorphism**: Each subclass overrides the `use_power()` method to reflect its unique style
- **Expressive Output**: Each hero introduces themselves and performs their power in a personalized w

## 🎭 Part 2: Polymorphism Challenge — *Vehicles in Motion*

This section explores polymorphism through a shared method `move()` across multiple vehicle classes. Each subclass redefines the method to reflect its unique behavior.

### 🚗 Vehicle Classes:
- `Vehicle` (base class)
- `Car` — "Driving on the highway 🚗"
- `Plane` — "Flying through the clouds ✈️"
- `Bicycle` — "Pedaling down the lane 🚲"
- `Rocket` — "Launching into space 🚀"
